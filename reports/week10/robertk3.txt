Goals.
- Get a working version 1.
- Complete the first draft of our final report. 

Progress:
We now have a working version of our project that can be used to clone repos, add repos, commit, push,
pull and view differences. We still need a ui component to show commit groups, and a button in the UI to
allow reverting. This is very close to a working version, and could potentially be used for user testing
however, implmenting these features and doing a bit of dogfooding to ensure the tool works as expected
is a good idea before proceeding with testing. We should defintely schedule testing with our peers for
the end of this week however.

Goals:
- Complete user testing.
- Update report with user testing data.
