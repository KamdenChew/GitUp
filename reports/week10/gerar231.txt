1. Goals for the week of 03/04/2019 - 03/10/2019:
    1. Add functionality to the UserAccount and ProjectManager modules for
    comparing version history of projects (for use by the GUI) and support
    project directory tracking with the Daemon.
    2. Complete a version one unit test suite for the above implementation.
    3. Complete one user test for the user account flow and functionality.

2. Progress for the week of 03/04/2019 - 03/10/2019:
    1. Functionality for version history comparison has been added to GitUp but
    is not currently located in the ProjectManager class. Project directory
    tracking with the Daemon has been completed as well after some major bug
    fixes during this previous week's work. Major learnings from these events
    relate to repository structure and code review/peer programming. Our team
    was able to drastically speed up our debugging capabilities simply by 
    cleaning up our repository and peer programming more often.
    2. No progress made here, seems like this goal was a bit ambitious but will
    carry over directly into this week as our team focuses in development and
    user testing.
    3. See above item #2.
    Summary: Things are coming together at an accelerating pace as we approach
    the final release of GitUp as they should be. The major goals left on
    the list is to support our implementation with development tests and our
    design with user tests in addition to adding some small pieces of code here 
    and there for functionality.

3. Goal's for the week of 03/11/2019 - 03/17/2019:
    1. Complete the implementation of ProjectManager and UserAccount modules
    by merging version history code and writing project deletion functions.
    2. Complete a version one unit test suite for both modules above.
    3. Complete a version one integration test for both modules above.
