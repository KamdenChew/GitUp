Last Week’s Goals: 
  - Our number one goal is to finish development of GitUp to the point where we can conduct a user test. This needs to get done ASAP.
  - Get users to complete our survey and analyze the results.
  - Add merge conflict resolution mechanism

Progress:
  - We were able to get GitUp to a state where a user could take our survey. We had 1 user test this past week. 
  - This user test showed us that setting up GitUp and adding a local project were fairly easy and intuitive for the user 
    (9 and 5 minutes respectively), but when it came time to add remote projects, view and compare file versions, and revert changes, 
    the user was unable to figure out what to do, even with our user manual at their disposal. This tells us that there’s gaps in our 
    user manual that need to be addressed specifically for these three operations.
  - While thinking about how we should tackle this last feature, we decided it would be best to just use Git’s merge mechanism for 
    merge conflict resolution. We haven’t started implementing this yet, but since we are using an already existing tool for this 
    we don’t expect it to take too much time.

Plans/Goals:
  - Update our user manual, aiming to improve clarity on how to add remote projects, view and compare files, and revert changes.
  - Bug fixes
  - Any bugs that we don’t have time to fix will be added as issues to our repository.
  - Finish implementing auto-merge

TA Meeting Agenda:
Treat Martin as a Lead Software Engineer:
  1. Any ideas on packaging GitUp to be highly portable? 
Treat Martin as a TA:
  1. If we change up our user manual before continuing user testing, should we exclude the user test results from before we made the edits?
Treat Martin as a Customer:
  1. What would you most likely use GitUp for in its current state?
