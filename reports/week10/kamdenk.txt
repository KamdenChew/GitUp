1. Goal's for the week of 03/04/2019 - 03/11/2019:
    1. Clean up and finalize our build system, as well as provide a way to download an executable for GitUp. We're looking at 
       the Freeze utility to create a python executable.
       
    2. First implementation of smart groupings of commits.
    
    3. At least one user test.
    
2. Progress for the week of 03/04/2019 - 03/11/2019:
    1. The CI for our project now runs the build system on every commit, and is compiling every python file in our directory as
       well. CI is currently passing for our last few commits. I was able to play around with cx_Freeze for Python executables
       and create an executable that opens up the GUI, and am making progress towards it packaging the backend as well with the
       GUI.
    
    2. We have functionality for getting a python map that stores information about commits based on their time stamp (date).
    
    3. Unfortunately we still didn't get any user tests done
      
3. Goal's for the week of 03/11/2019 - 03/18/2019:
  1. Finish GitUp for user testing purposes, and perform user tests.
