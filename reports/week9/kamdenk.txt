1. Goal's for the week of 02/23/2019 - 03/01/2019:
    1. Complete an initial usable product by linking together our currently separated modules (GUI, Git integration, and daemon 
       monitoring). This will be the bulk of our efforts this week.
       
    2. Pick a method of user testing based on feedback given, and then perform an initial user test.
       
2. Progress for the week of 02/23/2019 - 03/01/2019:
    1. We managed to create a usable product that tracks and commits changes to repositories. Repositories are also able to be
       received from GitHub through our login service. We now have the GUI, Git integration, and daemon monitoring working in
       tandem for at least partial functionality, which was our goal.
    
    2. We were unable to perform tests with users outside of our own team, but we managed to make a lot of progress on implementation
       which was very important this week. A demo was created though for the presentation that at least somewhat simulates user
       interactions.
      
3. Goal's for the week of 03/01/2019 - 03/07/2019:
    1. Clean up and finalize our build system, as well as provide a way to download an executable for GitUp. We're looking at 
       the Freeze utility to create a python executable.
       
    2. First implementation of smart groupings of commits.
    
    3. At least one user test.
