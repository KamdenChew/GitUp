Last Week’s Goals: 
  - Finish a usable prototype of GitUp.
  - Have real users test our initial version with pushing/pulling (in the context of our Google Survey)
  - Look at the generated graphs from our Google survey results, as well as the notes from our experienced user pool and come to 
    conclusions about what GitUp is lacking.
  - Begin work on smarter groupings of commits.

Progress:
  - While there are still some use cases that GitUp is unable to handle, we have managed to connect the GUI, daemon, and GitHub 
    integration and have them communicating.
  - All the pieces of our project work independently. The issue is with integrating them together
  - We’re aware we’re still behind on implementation, and we’ve devoted extra time this week to get an initial product that we 
    can give out for our user tests.
  - We have no user testing results yet, but we did remodel our user testing to be less expensive and taxing on our users. 
  - We’ve been focusing primarily on making sure that GitUp can support our user survey in terms of functionality. Because of this, 
    we haven’t focused much on smarter groupings of commits, although we do have an initial algorithm that groups commits based on 
    the time they were created (into buckets of a day). We can also now track which methods were edited in which file (similar to diff 
    show-c-function) which will be useful for smarter group algorithms eventually.

Plans/Goals:
  - Our number one goal is to finish development of GitUp to the point where we can conduct a user test. This needs to get done ASAP.
  - Get users to complete our survey and analyze the results.
  - Add merge conflict resolution mechanism

TA Meeting Agenda:

Treat Martin as a Lead Software Engineer:
  - How should our repository be organized?
  - Are there any problems with our current repository organization?

Treat Martin as a Customer:
  - What are your thoughts on the GUI design?
  - Does anything seem poorly designed/hard to use?
  - Is there functionality you expect to see but isn’t present?
