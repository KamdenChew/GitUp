1. Goals for the week of 02/11/2019 - 02/17/2019:
    0. Complete a v1 API which gives the functionality of each module and their
    interactions.
    1. Seek out some high-level research papers on GitUp's competition and cite 
    them in justifying features of the product.
    2. Test the feature set of GitUp with users by demonstrating the user 
    interface and core functionality, record at least two trials.

2. Progress for the week of 02/11/2019 - 02/17/2019:
    1. [first goal accomplishments, learnings, difficulties, blockers, 
    new ideas/directions]
    ...
    N. [Nth goal accomplishments, learnings, difficulties, blockers, 
    new ideas/directions]
    Summary: [summary of the week's progress]  
    0. This goal no longer seems relevant for GitUp's implementation and is
    actually covered better through objectives such as creating a test suite
    and a high quality user manual. The closest to an "API" that GitUp will see
    will be through method comments/specifications that enable the interactions
    between modules such as the UI, UserAccount and daemon. As it stands code
    has been written for all three of these components, it would make sense to
    continue this goal in some form by urging for the creation of some internal
    documentation to make module interactions easier and more abstract for the
    GitUp development team.
    1. One research paper cited in the project was "What's Wrong with Git?..."
    although this obviously only satisfies 1/2 of the goal's requirements. 
    Another place to utilize research in support of GitUp would be in creating
    test suites for the project and moving forward with user testing. It will be
    very important to read up on proper user testing in completing goal #2 from
    this week before the product demo on 02/21/2019.
    2. No progress was made on this goal because no implementation was ready
    for the user to demo. This goal should carry over well into this week since
    a version 1 of the UI will be ready and we will be doing a demo on 02/21/2019.
    As referenced above, in order for these tests to be effective they should be
    well documented and user testing methods should be support by research in
    order to maximize the insights produced from each session. 
    Summary: Overall the goals set for this week seemed out of synchronization
    with the actions that were taken. I think from a high level this previous
    week was a big step for GitUp in integrating more research into our project
    and begining to build each module. Learnings from this week relate to the
    practice of peer programming, which our group did on Saturday 02/16/2019,
    initially code moved slowly but by the end of the 4 hour session we had done
    quite a bit of the version 1 implementation and should have no problem
    getting a demo out by Thursday for check in.

3. Goal's for the week of 02/18/2019 - 02/24/2019:
    1. Complete a working demo of GitUp (logging changes to project files in a
    dynamic way) by 02/21/2019 for check-in.
    2. Read research on user testing and document findings in the repository 
    with preliminary user test designs.
    3. Perform one well documented user test before the 02/21/2019 demo and
    one user test afterwards.
