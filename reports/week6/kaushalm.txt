Goals for this week:
I plan to work with my team to finalize the high level architecture this week. Additionally, I plan to
properly allocate roles within our team and to begin the process of integrating our playtesters for GitUp
into the development process.

Progress this week:
- Revised and sharpened the motivation for GitUp - specifically, I found a paper on Gitless
that criticizes Git
- Touched up architecture diagram and GUI mockups
- I'm rusty on Python and unfamiliar with Tkinter and GitPython, so I spent time familarizing myself with the interfaces
- Fine-tuning and finalizing methodology for collecting user data/feedback on GitUp
- Helped produce the slides for the presentation, was involved in high level structure of it
-Began work on user manual, integrating feedback from last report

Goals for next week (2/11-2/18):
- Finish implementing automatic pushing/pulling
- Finish user manual
- Send out first user feedback survey/poll
- Continue improving my proficiency with GitPython and Tkinter
