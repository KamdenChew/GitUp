Goals:- Finish looking into the linux daemon.- Begin coding the linux daemon, or if the group determines a different plan piece of the code should be written first begin coding that.- Help write the team status report and plan for the meeting with Martin.

Progress:
This week I not only began coding the daemon, but finished it's core functionality. File edits in the repositories listed in /usr/share/gitup/repositories.csv are monitored and forwarded to the Repository objects themselves who can then be set up to commit the changes. The work of actually committing the changes is set to be done tomorrow when the group meets up to merge our various changes into one working demo.

Goals For Next Week:
