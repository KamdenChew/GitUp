Goals:
- Get a working demo created for the meeting with Martin
- Write tests for the daemon and git committing/pushing/pulling code.
- Begin work on the UI and user interaction with GitUp

Progress:
This week I suceeded in creating a demo for the meeting with Martin that showed the committing
functionality. I ended up getting sick and having to work on other projects so I did not get the
chance to write tests for the daemon. I also believe that given our status as being fairly behind
on work completed this time might be better spent assisting with the UI and getting a working
product. I am a little unsure as to what the status of the UI is and have not been able to help out
hopefully after a team meeting tomorrow and the other status reports being commited this will become
more clear. I have also volunteered to conduct the pilot study for how we will evaluate GitUp that should
be occuring later this week.

Goals For Next Week:
- Begin working on the UI and getting a working product
- Finish the pilot study and get ready to perform the study on actual users
- Evaluate various grouping/squishing strategies to make dealing with frequent commits
  less cumbersome.
