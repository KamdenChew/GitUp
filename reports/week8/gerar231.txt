1. Goals for the week of 02/18/2019 - 02/24/2019:
    1. Complete a working demo of GitUp (logging changes to project files in a
    dynamic way) by 02/21/2019 for check-in.
    2. Read research on user testing and document findings in the repository 
    with preliminary user test designs.
    3. Perform one well documented user test before the 02/21/2019 demo and
    one user test afterwards.

2. Progress for the week of 02/18/2019 - 02/24/2019:
    1. A working demo which demonstrated file monitoring through the use of a
    daemon was shown at the check-in on 2/21/2019. In the process of building
    this our team was able to iterate on the modules of development for GitUp.
    I personally didn't play a huge role in creating this demo since my work
    involves communication between local and remote repositories on a specific
    user account. Overall, based on this metric, our project is in a decent
    place to move forward with development towards a finished version of our
    system. 
    2. As of now the user test metrics have been designed according to ease of
    use, functionality, speed and overall preference for users. Data gathering
    tools (excel and Google Forms) have been tested and are functional. The
    project proposal has been updated to include far more research that
    justifies GitUp's functionality and compares existing alternatives. Research
    also supports implementation and testing methodologies. In this process our
    team was really able to articulate the most beneficial and essential features
    of the product. I didn't take a very active role in designing the user tests
    but will when user tests are created for the login flow.
    3. No user tests were performed in this previous week since our user testing
    had not been fully designed. Nothing in particular was learned here since
    this goal was not even attempted. If anything, I'd be interested to see when
    this actually gets performed, ideally by the end of this upcoming week!
    Summary: Progress seemed pretty binary this week, goals 1 and 2 were nearly
    completed while goal 3 was not event attempted. Moving forward in this week
    my focus is to set goals that are 100% relevant to this week's activities.
    Additionally, it would be optimal to achieve nearly 100% of the goal
    objectives. I also want to be more involved with the user testing side of
    the project as the implementation nears completion.

3. Goal's for the week of 02/25/2019 - 03/03/2019:
    1. Complete the version one implementation of the GitUp user account and 
    remote repository control.
    2. Complete a version one unit test suite for the above implementation.
    3. Complete one user test for the user account flow and functionality.
