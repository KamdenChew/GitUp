GoalsI forgot to turn in goals from last week so there wasn’t a formal written down version of this, however my goals were to:- Help with the slides for our presentation- Help with the user manual- Look into how linux handles file opening (i.e. what system calls and whether a log of these calls is available) and how a daemon would be written.
ProgressI contributed to the slides, by choosing the designs and ensuring the layouts all look professional and readable. I also edited the slides for content to make sure they were consistent with our proposal and what we have learned so far. I am set to work with the team later tonight on the user manual however as of writing this report that meeting has not happened. I have not looked into the linux daemon stuff yet; however, I am planning on doing that on Tuesday morning since we don’t have class and I will have to use my time somehow.
:Goals for Next Week:- Finish looking into the linux daemon.- Begin coding the linux daemon, or if the group determines a different plan piece of the code should be written first begin coding that.- Help write the team status report and plan for the meeting with Martin.
