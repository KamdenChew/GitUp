What I accomplished this week:
This week, I worked with my group to improve upon the project proposal from our project pitches.
We put in a fair amount of time in the project proposal, but while the final product we delivered
had its strengths, it was far from perfect. We were missing some important parts in our proposal,
specifically research, a compelling motivation, and measurable tests. Over the course of the weekend, I have
been working towards filling these gaps. In addition, I've researched into potential high level designs and
architecture for our project. I also worked on the peer review for the proposal, and was inspired by the
group we were peer reviewing with regards to making a compelling motivation. I also talked to some of my freinds,
and have gotten 3 of them to agree to serve as testers for GitUp.

What I hope to accomplish next week:
I plan to work with my team to finalize the high level architecture this week. Additionally, I plan to
properly allocate roles within our team and to begin the process of integrating our playtesters for GitUp
into the development process.
