The Excel Spreadsheet "Survey Data Analysis" is intended to be written too with results from our Google survey.

The spreadsheet produces 4 bar graphs. Each bar graph has 3 bars on the x-axis, representing each of Git, GitKraken, 
and GitUp. The graphs differ in their y-axes, where one measures average number of tasks completed in 30 minutes, one 
measures the number of votes for most functional VCS tool, one measures the number of votes for easiest to use VCS 
tool, and the last measures the number of votes for the best overall VCS tool.

The spreadsheet requires 6 inputs from the survey for each survey response:
1. The number of tasks completed using Git
2. The number of tasks completed using GitKraken
3. The number of tasks completed using GitUp
4. The vote for most functional (Git, GitKraken, or GitUp)
5. The vote for easiest to use (Git, GitKraken, or GitUp)
6. The vote for best overall (Git, GitKraken, or GitUp)

The spreadsheet currently can store up to 100 survey responses, but can be easily expanded.
For a user to see the results, all they need to do is open the excel spreadsheet. Then, they
can view the automatically generated graphs to see our results.

We'll also store individual feedback responses based off of using GitUp for an actual software
project as text files in this directory that a user can click on to read.
