To run the executable, you must first download the "GitUp.zip" file here: 
https://www.dropbox.com/s/celcc3fzbf8cvg9/GitUp.zip?dl=0

Next, unzip GitUp.zip, which should provide a directory called GitUp.
This directory includes the executable "gui", among other necessary files. For this reason, please do not restructure the directory.
